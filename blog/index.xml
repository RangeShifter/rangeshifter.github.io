      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been picked to host a RangeShiftR workshop at the IBS 2022 in Vancouver! Obviously, the IBS biennial meeting was planned for 2021 but was postponed due to Covid-19 restrictions and concerns. But Vancouver is definetely worth the wait. In the meantime, we will host an IBS online workshop over the coming year. So stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are proud and exhausted after finishing our first RangeShiftR workshop in Berlin today. This was the first real-life test of our R package. We are very grateful to the participants to help us finding all the bugs and for giving useful suggestions for improvements. Four projects were developed over the last three days:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
